creating admin-dashboard using grid layout mainly

I haven't yet taken responsive design in css so i am facing an issue with trying to not make the page scrollable, yet the problem i am facing is that at a certain height, the minimum content height doesn't fit into the body so it overflows it and causes scrolling of the whole viewport to take place.

an assumption I will be making is that the required screen size for this to work is 1260x595 (my default viewport size when browsing over chrome). 

Later courses will allow me to build more responsive designs. For right now, I am just applying what I have learnt in the previous lessons. So lets focus on bringing that side to light :D!
